# Learn AI

### Overview

This are all the notes and he code cells I did through out my learning AI algorithms and implementation, this notes can serve as future refrence and as a base for a curriculum if needed .



## Notes design 

while makeing the project I kept in mind the following :
- Starting with basic AI knowledge (regression, sigmoid , classification ....), reaching  neural network with diffrent layer types and activation function.
- The notes will use simple examples (so we can follow with paper and our Math).
- Include as many screenshots and markup text to explain the theory part.
- The notes uses libraries and images that are stored in the resources file ( adviced to check it up on your free time )
